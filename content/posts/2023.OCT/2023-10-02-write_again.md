# record again

writing in english has become an essential part of arch linux. for some reason no chinese user use pinyin there because popular repository (for arch)has not been update for a long time.

i enter the depression time again. not care about the world, not care about the life, not care about the future, not want to eat, nor move, nor learn anything. i just want to sleep and sleep. i want to sleep forever. i want to sleep in the dream. i want to sleep in the dream forever. sleep late and wake up late.

so sad. although i have a lot of things to do, but don't want to do any of them. all the things are boring. i'm been used to lonely, depress, anything... even can't find a familiar language to describe my feeling.

i am so sorry.tired....lost words and other express way. i don't know what to say. i don't know what to do. i don't know what to think. i don't know what to write. i don't know what to learn. i don't know what to eeeeeeee.

i know, poor language cause poor thinking, this is trying to make me only to think work and no other things. i know, i know, i know. but i can't do a thing to change it.

if i have no way to express myself, should i learn more writing skills?

always that answer...
