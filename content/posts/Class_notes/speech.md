[1]Teacher and Classmates,[2]

Good morning![3] Today, I am thrilled to introduce you to a technology that feels almost futuristic, yet is increasingly becoming a part of our everyday lives.[4] This technology allows us to see what our naked eyes cannot - the world of heat. Yes, I am talking about Thermal Imaging.

Now, to give you a better understanding of what thermal imaging is, let’s watch a short video that introduces this remarkable technology.

So thermal imaging technology captures this invisible world of heat differences and translates it into an image that we can see and understand. It’s like having a sixth sense that reveals a whole new world to us.

The importance of thermal imaging cannot be overstated. It’s not just about seeing in the dark or through obstructions - it’s about understanding our environment on a deeper level.

In this presentation, we will delve into the fascinating world of thermal imaging. We will understand how it works, examine its practical applications, and discover why it has become such an invaluable tool in so many fields.

The basic principle behind thermal imaging is straightforward: all objects emit infrared energy as a function of their temperature. Infrared energy is light that is not visible to the human eye because its wavelength is too long to be detected. It’s part of the electromagnetic spectrum that we perceive as heat.

Before we move on, let’s take a moment to watch another video that explains the principle behind thermal imaging in more detail.

Unlike visible light, in the infrared world, everything with a temperature above absolute zero emits heat. Even very cold objects, like ice cubes, emit infrared. The higher the object’s temperature, the greater the IR radiation emitted.

This brings us to the end of my part of the presentation.But our journey into the world of thermal imaging does not end here. Now, let’s welcome Yanyuanhao to delve deeper into thermal imaging and its applications.
