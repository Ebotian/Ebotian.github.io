# weekly report?

This week, ppt, anki and study source is the main things have been done. Call to Dr.Water Glass has been successful, she said next week I can still make a call, and she will be back home before P.M.9:50. I still don't know what my work will be next week, if possible I want to call her every Tuesday, and if that fails, try another call on Friday. friday could be my "friend day".

ppt is not perfect, but teacher said my English pronunciation sounds great, this encourage me to study English very hard. it's also my like for a long time, but for years, it only used in texts and exams for me. i need to make a change. both in writing and pronunciation, it's a common week in our society even for educated man. And i think using a different language is really cool, and for the same reason i didn't use windows for a really long time, gui also. Command line is like my home now. i'm using anki now, and i could feel it does increase my english (with my courage and effort).

about the future, recently many companies came to our school to choose suitable ones. and as their requirements, seems none of the jobs related to what i learn would hire me. future is not bright, but i don't want to prepare for another big entrance examination and another three years of youth life just for a license at all. but i don't know what other ways could lead me to a happy life.

I paid for a course online for the first time, but I think I won't learn it seriously like all other attempts before, because of too many school works and context difference, to learn something for a foreign examination could be at a really high risk not fit on school lecture. and the result is getting a fail like the last term.

I also sleep too late from this week, it's a really bad signal shows the possible depression might come the next few days or week. must do something to protect me from depression.
